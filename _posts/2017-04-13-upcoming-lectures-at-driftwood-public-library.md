<a href="http://www.driftwoodlib.org/" target="_blank">Driftwood Public Library</a> in Lincoln City has selected <a href="http://amzn.to/2p11dfj" target="_blank">Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore</a> for their 2017 Everybody Reads event. They've invited me to give two lectures. This is going to be fun!

## Secret Societies in Fiction

**Tuesday, April 25, 6:30pm**

This is going to be a lecture about secret societies. I'm going to talk about what a secret society is, and then we'll look at how they're portrayed in fiction. We will also talk about how fictional secret societies have sometimes become *real* secret societies, and the relationship between secrecy and fiction in the real world.

## How Computers Changed Cryptography

**Wednesday, April 26, 2:00pm**

If you saw <a href="https://arnesonium.com/2017/03/omsi-science-on-screen-the-imitation-game/">my OMSI talk</a>, then you already know that this is a subject I'm passionate about! I will be discussing the history of computers and how it's intertwined with the cryptography arms race. Maybe I will even introduce some hand ciphers to the crowd! I am going to have fun with this one.

I am sure that more information on both of these will be available soon, including Facebook events and other such things. In the meantime, visit the <a href="http://www.driftwoodlib.org/" target="_blank">Driftwood Public Library website</a> for more information.
