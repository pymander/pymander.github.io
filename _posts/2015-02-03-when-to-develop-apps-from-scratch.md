I haven't had time to write anything interesting for the blog this week, so instead check out Sebastian Green's article, <a href="http://www.developerdrive.com/2015/02/a-transparent-box-the-case-for-developing-from-scratch/" target="_blank">"A transparent box: the case for developing from scratch,"</a> which has been published over at Developer Drive.

Mr Green makes some great arguments for developing from scratch. Good software takes good planning, no matter what.
