I just checked Google Analytics, and over the last 18 months, my online article "Symbolism in Masonic Rings" has had over 6,000 page views. That's excellent!

If you're interested, you can <a href="http://transformason.org/papers/masonic_rings.html">read it on Transformason.org</a>. Please excuse the website. There's a reason I outsource web design tasks.
