I have been involved in the computer science world and the IT industry for over 20 years. My experience provides me with the skills and
knowledge needed to perform various parts of intellectual property research. I love prior-art searching. Digging through old research papers
and patents is something I really enjoy. I have several areas of expertise in this field.

- Databases
- Cryptography
- Internet protocols
- Email
- Web technology
- Privacy and security
