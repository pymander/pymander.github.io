I've upgraded to a 4096-bit RSA OpenPGP key. The new key fingerprint is <a href="https://arnesonium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/16EC3D6E.asc">FB05 D043 5BA4 6C32 66AE  2F74 17D0 60A6 16EC 3D6E</a> and you can download it by clicking on that link.

The key is also available on your favorite PGP keyserver, or through my <a href="https://keybase.io/earneson" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keybase account</a>.
