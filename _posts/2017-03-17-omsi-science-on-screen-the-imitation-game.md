On March 28th, I will be giving a lecture called "Computers and the Dawn of Modern Cryptography" at OMSI as part of their Science on Screen program. I'll be speaking and answering questions just before a screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/" target="_blank">The Imitation Game</a>, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. I am really excited about this opportunity! Please come down to OMSI for an informative lecture and an excellent film.
