After switching to SSL, you might want to read about <a href="http://www.developerdrive.com/2015/06/7-essential-steps-for-hardening-wordpress /" target="_blank">hardening your WordPress site against malicious use</a>.

Finally, learn how to <a href="http://darkmatters.norsecorp.com/2015/06/16/finding-hacking-services-and-more-in-the-deep-web/" target="_blank">hire a hacker on the deep web</a>, and read <a href="https://medium.com/@torproject/tor-s-summer-of-privacy-2a090016f8b2" target="_blank">an interview with Jesse Victors</a>, a new Tor developer.
