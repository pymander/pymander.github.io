I write for <a href="https://lionswaycontent.com">Lion's Way</a>. I've written great things with them, including technical briefs, case studies, and white papers. The collaborative process is key to our high-quality results.

I have also written for the <a href="https://kubernetes.dev/">Kubernetes project</a>.
