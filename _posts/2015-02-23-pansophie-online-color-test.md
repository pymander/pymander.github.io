<a href="http://eyesandedge.com/pansophie/" target="_blank">Pansophie Personality and Color</a> is focused on mapping personalities to colors. Alexandra Hall wanted an online testing platform with flexible questions, testing mechanisms, and report generation. I built a full-featured web application to meet Pansophie PC's requirements. This was one of my early Zend Framework projects, but it ended up with some neat features.

<ul>
	<li>A private administrative interface</li>
	<li>Seamless jQuery-backed test interface with few pageloads</li>
	<li>Custom PDF reports, generated on the fly</li>
	<li>A customer database with contact information</li>
	<li>API endpoints for test generation</li>
	<li>Integration with 3rd party e-commerce system</li>
</ul>

Pansopie PC isn't currently doing business.
