Your WordPress site is either making you money or costing you opportunities. I'm opening up my calendar for quick-turn projects—and offering **free site audits to new clients.**

**With 10+ years building WordPress sites,** I've seen the same problems tank small business budgets: slow load times, security vulnerabilities, broken plugins, and sites that just stop working.

<!--more-->

## What I'm Offering

See the full list on my [WordPress services page](/wordpress/). Here is a quick rundown:

- Quick-turnaround emergency WordPress rescue
- Site speed optimization
- Security hardening
- Plugin customization 

I am also available for **monthly WordPress support retainers.**

## First-Time Client Special

**Free 30-minute WordPress site audit (normally $75)**

### What you'll get:

- Speed analysis with specific fixes
- Security vulnerability check
- Plugin bloat assessment
- Prioritized action plan

**No obligation.** Just honest feedback on what's holding your site back.

## Between the lines

I'm based in Portland, but work with businesses anywhere. Projects are priced for value and speed—not hourly rates that incentivize me to work slowly.

The bottom line: **If your WordPress site is slow, insecure, or broken, you're losing money every day.** Let's fix it this week, not next quarter.
