I have over 20 years of experience developing&nbsp;web applications. I've worked on some big-name projects in the past, but now the projects I love are small and short-term. I enjoy working with individuals and small companies to build web applications targeted at their needs. <strong>I&nbsp;can get your custom web application to market&nbsp;in just a matter of weeks.</strong>

My experience with popular frameworks such as WordPress, Jekyll, and Zend Framework allows me to integrate exciting, cutting-edge features into my clients' software. These are some of the features I've developed and deployed in the past.

 - Social media integration
 - Text message interface
 - Amazon Web Services integration
 - Custom PDF reports
 - WordPress plugins
 - Big Data management and analysis
 - Full private administrative interfaces
 - Public-facing pages matching existing styling

To keep your website looking sharp, I work with top-notch, high quality web designers.
