This is my first attempt at using [elfeed-curate](https://github.com/rnadler/elfeed-curate) to collect interesting blog posts and share them. I have also attempted to subscribe to the RSS feed for the #Emacs hashtag on Mastodon, but that doesn't seem to be working correctly yet. I've seen other blogs do similar things, but is this useful for my blog? I don't know! Let me know what you think.

## Computers (4)

-   [The intriguing announcement of Cloudflare Fonts](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2023/10/cloudflare-fonts/?utm_campaign=RSS&utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=RSS) (Bryce Wray) **[Programming]**
    Oooh, this is cool. Bryce Wray talks about the introduction of Cloudflare Fonts!
-   [What to know about new generative AI tools for criminals](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-to-know-about-new-generative-ai-tools-for-criminals/) (Mike Elgan) **[Security]**
    Generative AI is still a minor concern for security professionals, but the threat is rising! This is
    an interesting look at the state of the art and current means for addressing the threat.
-   [Alex Schroeder: 2022-03-20 Torchbearers and bodyguards](https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2022-03-20_Torchbearers_and_bodyguards) (Alex Schroeder) **[Emacs]**
    Alex Schroeder continues his exploration of running tabletop RPGs using Emacs. Check out the other
    blog posts in the series&#x2014;they are a lot of fun. I have been playing with Emacs for running TTRPGs,
    as well. Someday I'll explain my methods.
-   [Elfeed-curate](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11683) (jcs) **[Emacs]**
    Elfeed-curate sounds like a really neat package. This is my first annotation using that package,
    which I will soon attempt to export.


## Portland (1)

-   [Tour of Untimely Departures – SOLD OUT!](https://www.friendsoflonefircemetery.org/?p=943) (lfadmin)
    The Tour of Untimely Departures is an annual event at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland. But guess what?
    It's already sold out! It sold out a while back, but I didn't notice because my RSS feed for the
    Friends of Lone Fir was broken.
