<a href="http://www.pugspdx.com/" title="Portland Underground Graduate School" target="_blank">Portland Underground Graduate School</a> (PUGS) has invited me to teach a class on the history of cryptography starting May 4th. The class will be four sessions and is very affordable: only $40!

We will cover the basics of cryptography, where it came from, and why it's important. In addition, I will teach you how to use a number of manual cryptographic techniques. I'm really excited about this class, and I can't wait to share my knowledge!
