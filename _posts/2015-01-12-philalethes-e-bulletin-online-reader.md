<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screenshot-from-2014-12-18-214441.png#left" alt="Philalethes Society Seal" width="203" height="171" class="alignright size-full wp-image-189" />I began working on the <a href="http://freemasonry.org/ebulletin/" title="Philalethes E-Bulletin" target="_blank"><em>Philalethes E-Bulletin</em></a> in the Fall of 2013, and published the first issue in January of 2014. The <em>E-Bulletin</em> is published quarterly in EPUB and MOBI formats.

It's been a great learning experience. Not only have I learned a lot about editing, but I've really had to dive into how electronic publishing works. The intricacies of electronic book formats have become well-known to me.

The Philalethes Society isn't entirely comfortable with modern technology, however. Most complaints about the <em>E-Bulletin</em> came from those who didn't have e-book readers and weren't comfortable installing software on their PC to handle a new file format. Because of this, I built an online e-book reader specifically for the <em>E-Bulletin</em>.

The online e-book reader is based around the excellent <a href="https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/" target="_blank">EPUB.js library</a>, with additional backend code written in PHP.
