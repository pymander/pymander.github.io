Raspberry Pis are super cool. One of the neat things about them is that they have a ton of general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins, so you can use them to control all sorts of external devices. Unfortunately, most of the examples and applications are written in Python. I know, a lot of people really love Python, but it's just not my cup of tea.

Enter the <a href="https://github.com/paoloo/gpio" target="_blank">Erlang Ï€GPIO library</a> by <a href="https://paoloo.github.io/" target="_blank">Paolo Oliveira</a>! This is a simple, straightforward library that implements the RPi GPIO stuff for Erlang. Using it, I have created an Erlang library to control a 28BYJ-48 5V stepper motor with a ULN2003 controller board.
