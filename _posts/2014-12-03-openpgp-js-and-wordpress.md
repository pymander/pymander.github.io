Near the end of November, I began fiddling with <a href="http://openpgpjs.org/" target="_blank">OpenPGP.js</a> and building a WordPress plugin. My goal is to create a method by which visitors can encrypt messages to me on my <a href="http://arnesonium.com/contact/" title="Contact">Contact page</a> using my public key.

I finished up a pretty simple little plugin. You can <a href="http://arnesonium.com/wordpress-openpgp/" title="OpenPGP Form Encryption for WordPress">view the details here</a> or head straight to the <a href="https://github.com/pymander/wordpress-openpgp">GitHub project page</a>.

However, when I finished earlier this week and decided to submit it to the WordPress Plugin Directory, I found that somebody had beat me to it by almost a month. I've taken a look at the code and it looks pretty good. You can check out my plugin, which was published as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/openpgp-form-encryption/" target="_blank">OpenPGP Form Encryption for Wordpress</a>, and you can check out the other guy's plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pgp-contact/" target="_blank">PGP Contact plugin</a>.
