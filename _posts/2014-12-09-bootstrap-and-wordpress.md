I've used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> many times in web applications. It really makes building an application interface fast and easy, primarily because I don't have to worry much about design. Bootstrap makes things a lot easier for a developer who doesn't do good design work.

Speaking of design work, this website is not very pretty at the moment. I want to make it look better, so I've been looking at different WordPress themes. A theme based on Bootstrap seemed like a good idea. That way, the appearance of my website would match the applications I've built for my clients. Nice, right? I came across <a href="http://320press.com/wpbs/" target="_blank">WordPress Bootstrap</a> from <a href="http://320press.com/" target="_blank">320 Press</a> and thought it might look good.

I decided to pursue other themes, however. My initial concern was that the website didn't look any better with WordPress Bootstrap, but I also realized that perhaps Bootstrap wasn't such a good fit for WordPress. Fr√§nk Klein makes some great arguments against a Bootstrap-backed WordPress theme in his article, <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2014/08/19/why-bootstrap-is-a-bad-fit-for-wordpress-themes/" target="_blank">Why Bootstrap is a Bad Fit for WordPress Themes</a>.
