Recently I wrote a tutorial with <a href="http://wordlions.com/" target="_blank">Word Lions</a> for <a href="http://ctl.io/" target="_blank">CenturyLink Cloud</a> that teaches how to build and deploy a Node.js application to CenturyLink AppFog. The tutorial and application were really fun to build and write. It was my first Node.js project, and my first experience with CloudFoundry. The tutorial uses the following CenturyLink Cloud products:

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ctl.io/appfog/">AppFog</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ctl.io/orchestrate/">Orchestrate</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ctl.io/object-storage/">Object Storage</a></li>
</ul>

AppFog is CenturyLink Cloud's CloudFoundry system. It is really powerful, and it appears to be more flexible than <a href="https://arnesonium.com/tag/google-cloud/">Google App Engine</a>.

<h2>Read the Tutorial</h2>

The tutorial walks you through building a document storage system with a built-in PDF reader and comment storage. It also includes user authentication and some other neat Node.js tricks. You can follow the tutorial from the following links, which will include all of the information needed to get you up and running on AppFog with Node.js. Enjoy!
