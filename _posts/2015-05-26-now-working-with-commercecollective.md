I am now working with my good friends at <a href="http://www.commercecollective.com/" target="_blank">CommerceCollective</a>! CommerceCollective is a web presence management company located here in Portland, Oregon, and they are great at SEO and social media stuff. They also are really talented web designers. If you're looking for a full website solution, from design down to the nuts and bolts, we are the place to go.

I'll be supplementing their services with full-stack web development, IT consulting, and a little bit of copy writing. <a href="http://www.commercecollective.com/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Read more about our team here!</a>
