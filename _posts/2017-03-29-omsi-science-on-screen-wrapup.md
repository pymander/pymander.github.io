My talk at OMSI last night, "Computers and the Dawn of Modern Cryptography," went really well. It was a great crowd and there was a good Q&A session afterwards. I'm going to keep this post really brief. First, there will be slides for my talk. Following that will be a brief bibliography if you're interested in learning more about this fascinating topic.
