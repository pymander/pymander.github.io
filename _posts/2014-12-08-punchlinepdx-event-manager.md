<a href="http://www.punchlinepdx.com/">PunchlinePDX</a> is a slow-motion video booth for events and parties based out of Portland, Oregon. Earlier this year, I helped them develop event management software that would allow them to upload and curate video.

This was their first experience hiring a software developer, so I had the opportunity to walk them through the entire process. We started by outlining requirements and coming up with a solid plan with application screens, functions, and things to meet their business needs. We then brainstormed additional features and came up with something pretty amazing.

These are a few of the interesting things we came up with:

<ul>
    <li>Cloud-backed storage for all videos</li>
    <li>Text messaging interface</li>
    <li>Smart social media sharing</li>
    <li>Contact management</li>
    <li>Event and sharing privacy</li>
</ul>

The best part was the testing process. While I ran them through their new software, they made slow-motion video of me and used the software to upload and manage it. Check it out!
