This past Fall, a bunch of big names <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/10/distrusting-wosign-and-startcom.html" target="_blank">removed StartCom from their trusted SSL Certificate Authority list</a>. As a result, when I renewed my SSL certificates this year, I went with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>. It was a pleasant experience, because Let's Encrypt uses a command-line client called <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank">Certbot</a> that does most of the heavy lifting for you.

After certificate renewal, everything is still looking pretty good. Please let me know if you have any SSL problems with my website through <a href="https://arnesonium.com/contact/">the contact form</a>.
