Back in 2012, I had the pleasure of working with my good friend Joel Barker on his amazing project, <a href="http://brunosanrafael.com/">Bruno San Rafael's Home for Former Trapeze</a>. This project is a collaboration between Joel, a bunch of musicians, a photographer, and a web developer (me!). My contribution was probably the smallest of the bunch, but it was a lot of fun.

Please check out the website by clicking on the screenshot below. If you use "View Source" in your browser, you can see every line of code I used to finish the site. It's one simple, medium-length monolithic HTML file with JavaScript and CSS thrown in.

I now work with Joel regularly at <a href="http://www.wordlions.com/">Word Lions</a>, where I write and do a little more website development.
