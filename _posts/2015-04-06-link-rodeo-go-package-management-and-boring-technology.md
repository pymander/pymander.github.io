Here are a number of interesting topics for you to think about this week.

I've been learning the <a href="http://arnesonium.com/tag/golang/" title="Go language">Go programming language</a> recently, and in the process I've been having conversations about it with friends and colleagues. Go has a unique package management system that has already caused me a number of headaches. The recommended method for taking care of package dependencies is lacking, at best. Over at Nerdbucket, my buddy Nerdmaster has written <a href="http://blog.nerdbucket.com/go-dependency-freezing/article" title="Go Dependency Freezing at Nerdbucket" target="_blank">a thoughtful piece about it</a>.

While I'm talking about new technology, I'd also like to contradict myself by agreeing with Dan McKinley's great piece, <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" title="Choose Boring Technology by Dan McKinley" target="_blank">"Choose Boring Technology."</a> He argues that a project should be careful about adopting lots of new tools and technologies. It reminds me of a time recently when I was looking for a Node.js programmer, and one of the replies I got back was, "For us, Node.js is glue. Its ecosystem is still too young to support anything long-term. Libraries and packages move too fast to build a product that will need actual maintenance." I've had the same feeling about many technologies I've wanted to try, such as <a href="http://ocsigen.org/" title="Ocsigen" target="_blank">Ocsigen for OCaml</a>, which has a build system and API that is always several steps ahead of its documentation.
